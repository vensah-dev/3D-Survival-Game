# a small survival game

I attempted to make a 3D survival game as my very first game on Unity with my prior experince being 3 years in Scratch. Took me 2 weeks to get a hand of C# but with all the free time in the holidays I was able to make some simple 3D procedural terrain generation following some tutorials. Eventually, I lost interest in it due to the project getting messy and because I had other projects to focus on.

## Features

- 1st person player controller
- infinite terrain generation with multithreading
- normal/hieght based splatmap terrain shaders
- falloff maps to create islands
- Foliage generators, supported for infinite terrain generation
- basic enemy AI: enemy will move around randomly until within a certain range and will attack player
- inventory system with a hotbar similar to minecraft
- item drops from folliage, enemies, etc...
- water
